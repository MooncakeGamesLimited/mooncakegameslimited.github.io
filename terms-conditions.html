We hereby grant you a personal, non-exclusive, non- transferable, terminable license to view and use the Services only for your personal use, subject to your compliance with these Terms. Except as expressly provided herein, we do not grant you any other express or implied rights or license in or to the Services, and all rights, title and interest that we have in the Services’ and rights not explicitly granted to you by the Company or the Company’s licensors are retained by the Company or the Company’s licensors, respectively. Your use of the Services is at your own risk, including the risk that you might be exposed to Content (as defined below) that is offensive, indecent, inaccurate, objectionable, or otherwise inappropriate.</p>
                <p>Except as expressly set forth in the Terms, you may not modify (including without limitation making derivative works), copy, adapt, reverse engineer, de-compile or otherwise reduce to human perceivable format, distribute, frame, reproduce, republish, download, scrape, display, post, transmit, transfer, license or sub-license, publicly display or sell in any form or by any means, in whole or in part, the Content of the Services without the Company’s or our licensors’ express prior written permission.

We have the absolute right to manage, regulate, control, modify and/or eliminate such Virtual Currency and/or Service Items as we see fit in our sole discretion, and we shall have no liability to you or anyone else for the exercise of such rights. For example, Virtual Currency and Service Items will be lost, deleted from your Account or forfeited when/if your Account is terminated, suspended or closed for any reason or when we discontinue any or all of the Services, including without limitation any services provided or offered through third party platforms.</p>
                <p>We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to make all calculations regarding the balance of Virtual Currency and Service Items in your Account.

                <p>Any unauthorized transferring, trading, selling or exchanging of any Virtual Currency, Service Items or Accounts (“Unauthorized Transactions”) with anyone, including with other users of the Services,is not sanctioned by us and is strictly forbidden. All users who participate in such activities do so at their own risk and hereby agree to indemnify the Company against any and all consequences resulting from such actions. You acknowledge that the Company may stop, suspend, terminate, discontinue or reverse any Unauthorized Transactions when the Company suspects or has evidence of fraud, violations of these Terms, violations of any other applicable law or regulation or any intentional act designed to interfere at all with the normal operation of the Services. You further agree that the Company may, in the Company’s sole discretion, reverse any transaction if such reversal is in the Company’s best interest, or may debit your balance of Virtual Currency or Service Items, including without limitation, taking actions, which may cause your balance to be zero and/or a negative amount. The Company may, in the Company’s sole discretion, terminate, suspend or modify your Account if you engage or assist in any Unauthorized Transactions.

We will not supply any products or services to you until the alternative billing and payment provider has authorized the use of your credit card or other applicable method for payment. If you use the services of an alternate billing and payment provider, you will be bound by that third party provider's terms and conditions, which are available from such provider. You may be required to create an account with such alternate provider, and to provide such provider with your bank account or credit or debit card details.</p>

                <p>These Terms and the relationship between you and the Company shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China (“Hong Kong”). If any dispute shall arise in connection with these Terms or Services, either party may initiate the dispute resolution procedures set forth in this Section by giving the other party written notice of such dispute (“Dispute Notice”). Following issuance of a Dispute Notice, the parties shall endeavor to resolve the dispute through negotiations conducted in good faith. All negotiations that take place in connection with the dispute shall be conducted in confidence and without prejudice to the rights of the parties in any future proceedings. If the dispute cannot be resolved through good faith negotiations within thirty (30) calendar days from the date upon which the Dispute Notice was issued, either party may submit the dispute to be finally resolved by arbitration under Hong Kong International Arbitration Center (the “HKIAC”) by written notice to the other party and to HKIAC. The number of arbitrators shall be one, the language to be used in the arbitration proceedings shall be English and the place of arbitration shall be Hong Kong. The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the HKIAC’s arbitration rules in effect at the time of applying for arbitration. Once a dispute is referred to arbitration, such dispute shall be finally and exclusively settled through binding arbitration unless the parties otherwise reach an agreement to resolve the dispute.</p>
